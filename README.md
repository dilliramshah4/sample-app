# Dr. ViKi DevOps Pipeline - Complete CI/CD Solution

##  Assignment Overview
This project demonstrates a complete DevOps pipeline with automated CI/CD, monitoring, and security scanning for a Flask web application deployed on Azure VM.

##  Architecture
- **Application**: Python Flask web app displaying "Hello from Dr. ViKi DevOps Pipeline!"
- **Containerization**: Docker with multi-stage builds
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions with automated testing and deployment
- **Infrastructure**: Azure Virtual Machine
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus + Grafana stack
- **Security**: Trivy vulnerability scanning

##  Live Application URLs

##  Technical Implementation

### Step 1: Sample Application
Flask application with timestamp display and health endpoints

### Step 2: Containerization
Docker containerization with Python slim base image for optimal performance

### Step 3: CI/CD Pipeline
- **Build**: Docker image creation
- **Test**: Endpoint testing with curl
- **Security**: Trivy vulnerability scanning
- **Deploy**: Automated deployment to Azure VM

### Step 4: Monitoring Stack
- **Prometheus**: Metrics collection from `/metrics` endpoint
- **Grafana**: Visualization dashboard with custom panels
- **Docker Compose**: Orchestrated monitoring services

### Step 5: Security & Cost Optimization

##  Security Measures Implemented
- Trivy vulnerability scanning in CI/CD pipeline
- SSH key-based authentication for deployment
- GitHub secrets for sensitive data management
- Network security groups with minimal port exposure
- Container security with non-root user execution

##  Cost Optimization Strategies
- **Resource Efficiency**: Using lightweight Python slim base image
- **Auto-scaling**: Can implement Azure VM Scale Sets for traffic-based scaling
- **Resource Scheduling**: Stop/start VMs during off-hours using Azure Automation
- **Container Optimization**: Multi-stage Docker builds to reduce image size
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus metrics help identify resource waste
